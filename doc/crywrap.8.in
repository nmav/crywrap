.BI "crywrap \-\-listen " HOST / PORT " \-\-destination " HOST / PORT

them to an unencrypted location.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.B CryWrap
takes the following options:
.SS "Required options"

.BI "\-\-destionation (\-d) " HOST / PORT
The destionation host and address, where CryWrap should connect
to. Both arguments are required.
.SS "TLS options"
.TP
.B \-\-anon (\-a)
Enables Anon-DH mode. If enabled, no certificate will be sent to the
client, and only anonymous sessions will be enabled.
.br
Default is \fBoff\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-\-pem (\-p) " cert = PATH , key = PATH
.TP
.BI "\-\-pem (\-p) " PATH
.br
The public certificate to send to clients, and the private server key.
If one of \fIcert\fR or \fIkey\fR is omitted, the value of the other
will be used for the missing one too.
If no \fIcert=\fR or \fIkey=\fR tag is given, \fIPATH\fR will be used
for both.
.br
Default is \fB@pkgconfdir@/server.pem\fR, unless \fB--anon\fR is also
specified, in which case no certificate will be used.
.TP
.BI "\-\-verify (\-v) [" LEVEL ]

not be verified.
