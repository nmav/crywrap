This is CryWrap, a simplistic daemon to add TLS/SSLv3 support to
services that do not support it.

See the NEWS file for a description of recent changes to CryWrap.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install the
program files.  See the CryWrap manual for details about
configuration.  Type "man crywrap" in the shell prompt.

This version of the tool is an updated version of the original tool
updated with the changes in gnutls' crywrap tool.

It is not actively maintained, and is available at:
